/**
 * A StreamParser provides a progressive parse of its input. As each Element is completed, it is emitted via a Stream or
 * Iterator interface. Elements returned will be complete with all their children, and an (empty) next sibling, if
 * applicable.
 *
 * Elements (or their children) may be removed from the DOM during the parse, for e.g. to conserve memory, providing a
 * mechanism to parse an input document that would otherwise be too large to fit into memory, yet still providing a DOM
 * interface to the document and its elements.
 *
 *
 * Additionally, the parser provides a [.selectFirst] / [.selectNext], which will
 * run the parser until a hit is found, at which point the parse is suspended. It can be resumed via another
 * `select()` call, or via the [.stream] or [.iterator] methods.
 *
 *
 * Once the input has been fully read, the input Reader will be closed. Or, if the whole document does not need to be
 * read, call [.stop] and [.close].
 *
 * The [.document] method will return the Document being parsed into, which will be only partially complete
 * until the input is fully consumed.
 *
 * A StreamParser can be reused via a new [.parse], but is not thread-safe for concurrent inputs.
 * New parsers should be used in each thread.
 *
 * If created via [Connection.Response.streamParser], or another Reader that is I/O backed, the iterator and
 * stream consumers will throw an [java.io.UncheckedIOException] if the underlying Reader errors during read.
 *
 * The StreamParser interface is currently in **beta** and may change in subsequent releases. Feedback on the
 * feature and how you're using it is very welcome
